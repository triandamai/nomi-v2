# Backend changes the new frontend needs

`frontend-new/` uses the backend API exactly as it is. When a flow in the design needs something
the API doesn't offer, it's written down here instead of being built or faked in the UI. Each
entry is checked against the backend's real routes first, and names the flow and step that need
it.

Nothing here has been implemented: these are requests for the backend.

## Entry format

### Short name
- **Needed by:** flow and step in `Nomi.pen` (e.g. *Flow / Chat — Share & delete*, step 2).
- **Why:** what the person can't do without it.
- **What exists today:** the closest current endpoint or behaviour, with its path.
- **Proposed contract:** method, path, request and response shape (a suggestion, open to change).
- **Until then:** what the frontend shows instead (the step is left out, never faked).

## Entries

None yet. Entries are added as each flow is built.
